          automated backup policy: we store backups for up to 30 days to ensure
          that, in case anyoneâ€™s data is accidentally wiped or a severe outage
          occurs, we can restore it. You have the right to request your data

          We cannot restore your account once it has been deleted. If you choose
          to return to the platform later, you will need to create a new account

          if you wish. If you want to keep your content but prevent others from
          viewing your account, deactivating your profile is the better option.
